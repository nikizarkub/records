            This project was created by Niki Zarkub for Web Design Decal, an introductory web design course offered by UC Berkeley.
            This project was inspired by a lot of things. My desire to have a record player, but not wanting to pay for one.
            My love for Disney music. My interest in creating digital artwork. My need to create a final project. </br></br>
            This site was created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I drew the artwork on the website; it was all inspired by Disney
            movie posters. The songs on this website all come from Disney movies. Below, you can see the relevant copyright information
            for the songs on this site. Just hover over the cards!
